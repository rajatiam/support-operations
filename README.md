# Support Operations

Triage support tickets and move issues toward resolution. Python FastAPI and Angular application with persistent local data and a container deployment path.

## Engineering focus

**Support lifecycle management.** A support engineer triages a customer issue and tracks its resolution.

Tickets progress from open through investigating to resolved. Resolved tickets cannot advance again.

The implementation includes cookie authentication, viewer/editor/administrator roles, CSRF checks, atomic audit events, optimistic concurrency, durable idempotent creates, soft deletion, database migrations, structured request logs and paginated APIs. Each repository runs independently.

## Run locally

Python 3.13 and Node.js 22 are used in CI. Install dependencies once; the application itself needs no cloud account or API key.

```sh
python -m venv .venv
# PowerShell: .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
# macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run build
cd ..
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py create-admin --username local-admin
python run.py
```

The admin command prompts for a password; use at least 12 characters. Open http://127.0.0.1:8104 and sign in. Local self-registration creates an editor account. API schema: http://127.0.0.1:8104/docs. Data persists in `data/app.db`.

For Angular live reload, run `npm start` in `frontend/` alongside the Python server. Its development proxy keeps API and cookie traffic on the browser's origin.

## Verify and deploy

```sh
python -m unittest -v
docker compose config
docker compose up --build
```

GitHub Actions runs the domain/security/concurrency tests, installs the pinned Angular lockfile, builds Angular and builds the non-root Docker image. Kubernetes examples are under `deploy/`; read the runbook before adapting them to a cluster.

## Example domain input

```json
{
  "subject": "Cannot sign in",
  "priority": "high",
  "status": "open"
}
```

Business fields are separate from server metadata: `id`, `version` (integer revision) and `created_at`. Writes use `If-Match`; retryable creates use `Idempotency-Key`.

## Scope

This is an engineering portfolio reference application. It demonstrates implemented design choices and failure handling; it does not claim live customer traffic or a production operating history. Deployment uses one workspace and one SQLite writer. See the documented tradeoffs and hardening work in the architecture and runbook.
